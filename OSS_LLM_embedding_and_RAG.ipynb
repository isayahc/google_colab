            "This paper describes a method for direct printing of conductive patterns using SWCNT inkjet technology. The authors investigate the effects of substrate temperature, overwriting time, and linewidth on the properties of the printed lines. They find that the uniformity of the SWCNT network is improved with increasing overwrite times and that the resistance of the lines can be controlled by changing the linewidth and the number of overwritings. The impedance of the printed lines is measured using an impedance analyzer, and it is found to be linearly reduced along with the increase of the overwriting times. The paper demonstrates the potential of SWCNT inkjet technology for fabricating high-performance conductive patterns on various substrates.\n"
